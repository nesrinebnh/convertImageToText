Mild Splendour of the various-vested Night!
Mother of wildly-working visions! hail!
I watch thy gliding, while with watery light
Thy weak eye glimmers through a fleecy veil;
And when thou lovest thy pale orb to shroud
Behind the gather’d blackness lost on high;
And when thou dartest from the wind-rent cloud
Thy placid lightning o’er the awaken’d sky.

Certainly theology needs empirical facts and scientific theoretical
insights. The social scientists offer help. Yet they do not accomplish
what I must now attempt. My main question is where and how the
church must stand to be the witnessing church; that is, what must be
the relation between the culture that is the church (and the larger
Christian and biblical metaculture the church represents) and those
cultures the church indwells, evangelizes, serves? Answering will
Tequire all the resources that Christian theology can bring to bear, and
not a little help from such as Berger and Bellah as well. Already they
have showed us, willy-nilly, that theology is required for the task: they
make such ample (and often skillful) use of it, themselves!

In facsimile a photocell is caused
to perform a raster scan over the
subject copy. The variations of print
density on the document cause the
photocell to generate an analogous
electrical video signal. This signal is
used to modulate a carrier, which is
transmitted to a remote destination
over a radio or cable
communications link.

At the remote terminal,
demodulation reconstructs the video
signal, which is used to modulate the
density of print produced by a
printing device. This device is
scanning ina raster scan
synchronised with that at the
transmitting terminal. As a result, a
facsimile copy of the subject
document is produced.
